## Tech used:
* LAMP stack which includes Linux, Apache2, MySQL and PHP

## Current issues:
* Unable to fix the connection with mysql server hence the table is not populating at the backend. Tried using PDO prepared statements instead of mysqli and got caught in synatx errors (should be fixed soon)

## Challenges faced:
* Setting up the LAMP stack from scratch
* Using Ubuntu (migrating from windows permanently)
* Have been learning MERN stack for the past few days hence old skills were rusty & required brush-up
